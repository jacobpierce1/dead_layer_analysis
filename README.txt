PURPOSE 

the data contained demonstrates that when alpha particles pass through the detector, there is a peak at the expected location offset by an amount of energy consistent with the a dead layer on the detector (part that doesn't absorb energy and convert to voltage). however there is also a smaller peak to the left which is hypothesized to be a deeper deadlayer of specified dimension. we test a model of geometry to determine whether it is consistent with the observed spectra.




data_from_mary obtains the data obtained from mary, including ROOT tree with the data necessary for the test.
