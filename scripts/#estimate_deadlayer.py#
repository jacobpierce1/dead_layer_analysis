# this script reads in dataframes containing: 1. the penetration angle
# of each pixel ( constructed in deadlayer_geometry.py ), 2. the mu
# values of each peak fit ( originally detected in parse_all_data.py
# and read into a matrix in deadlayer_analysis.py ) it then reads in a
# file of stopping power data and interpolates it. using all this data
# we make estimates of both the source dead layer depths and
# the pixel dead layer depth.
